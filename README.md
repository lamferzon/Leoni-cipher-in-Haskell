## Author ##
+ **Lorenzo LEONI**, postgraduate in Computer Engineering at University of Bergamo.

## Description ##
The *Leoni cipher* involves combined and iterated use of the modified Caesar algorithm and the Vigen√®re cipher. It is more complex and therefore less easily cracked than the ciphers previously mentioned thanks to its random and iterative components.
